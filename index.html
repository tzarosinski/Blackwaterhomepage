                        <p>Our land clearing service includes tree removal, stump grinding, brush clearing, debris hauling, and site leveling. We can clear small residential lots or large acreage.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, most East Texas counties require permits for driveways that connect to public roads, especially if a culvert is needed. We handle all driveway permits and culvert sizing requirements for Smith, Cherokee, Henderson, Gregg, Rusk, Van Zandt, Wood, and Anderson counties. Each county has different requirements for culvert size and driveway width - we know them all.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely! That's what "total site work" means. We coordinate septic installation, land clearing, house pad development, driveway construction, culvert installation, utility trenching, and electrical hookups. You work with one contractor instead of juggling 5-6 different companies. We're trusted by mobile home dealers throughout East Texas because we make the process simple and keep projects on schedule.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>East Texas has unique clay-heavy soils that require special expertise for septic systems and proper drainage. Our team understands local soil conditions and knows how to design septic systems and house pads that work with (not against) East Texas dirt. Poor drainage planning leads to failed septic systems and flooded building pads - we prevent those problems.</p>
